          <h1>The Aim of the Game</h1>

          <p>
            Welcome to the world of Minesweeper, a game of strategy and
            deduction where you must uncover hidden mines and navigate a
            treacherous grid without detonating any of these explosive hazards.
            Your goal is to identify and flag all the mines while revealing the
            safe squares, ultimately achieving victory by clearing the entire
            grid.
          </p>

          <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>

          <p>
            <span class="bold-game">Investigate:</span> Start by selecting a
            square by entering its row and column numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold-game">Reveal or Flag:</span> If the square is
            safe, a numerical value will appear, indicating the number of mines
            surrounding it. If it's a mine, the game ends abruptly, and you're
            declared the loser.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold-game">Deduce and Flag:</span> Utilize the revealed
            numbers to deduce the potential locations of hidden mines. If you're
            unsure about a square, enter "y" after selecting it to flag it as a
            suspected mine.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold-game">Strategy and Risk:</span> Carefully consider
            your moves, balancing the need to uncover safe squares with the
            potential risk of detonating a mine. Flagging potential mines can
            guide your decisions and reduce the risk of mishaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold-game">Victory and Defeat:</span> If you
            successfully flag all the mines while uncovering the safe squares,
            you emerge victorious. However, detonating a single mine results in
            your downfall, ending the game in defeat.
          </p>

          <h2>Inspiration</h2>

          <p>
            This game draws inspiration from the renowned classic Minesweeper, a
            staple of Windows operating systems for decades. The thrill of
            navigating a grid filled with unknown dangers and the satisfaction
            of clearing it unscathed have captivated players worldwide.
            Additionally, our implementation is heavily inspired by The Coding
            Train's "<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LFU5ZlrR21E"
              >Coding Challenge #71: Minesweeper</a
            >" video, which provides a comprehensive guide to creating this
            classic game.
